In the company I belong to, engineers not only make what they said, they are asked to work out ideas for service ideas and improvements.
Every time I try to squeeze out ideas, it is not easy for me to come up with a nice idea.

Therefore, the method of idea extraction called Osbourne checklist is useful.
This is the law of thinking by A Â· F Osbourne who is the inventor of brainstorming.

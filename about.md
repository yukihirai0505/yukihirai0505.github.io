I'm Yuki Hirai, a software developer in Tokyo, Japan.

I've included my [résumé](/images/resume.pdf) on this site in case you're interested in my background.

I enjoy working on all kinds of software development projects at my job and in my free time.
Right now I'm doing a lot of work with Scala.

You can find most of my software projects on my [github](https://github.com/yukihirai0505).
You can also find some of my older projects here.
